# Python-Arithmetic
## Introduction to the Program
My program is written to read from a (.txt) file that contains arithmetic, compute the answers to said arithmetic problems, and output the answers to another (.txt) file.
## Installation Process
To install this program simply:
1) Click the "Clone or Download" prompt
2) Click the "Download ZIP" prompt
3) Choose your desired install location (if not prompted it will automatically download to the User's Downloads folder)
4) Locate your download
5) Extract the "Python-Arithmetic-master" folder from its (.zip) folder
6) Move the "Arith.py" to the desired directory on your computer
7) Double click "Arith.py" to run
## How to Use "Arith.py"
As stated the "Arith.py" program reads and writes (.txt) arithmetic problems and answrs in that order. In short you will type the name of the file that has the arithmetic in it when prompted by "Read From:" and hit enter. Then you will type the name of the file you wish to output your answers to when prompted by "Write to:" followed by enter. the program will then prompt you that it has finished and you can hit enter to exit.
  ## Restrictions
  Since the program uses pythons string to int conversion there are a few things guidelines one has to follow to ensure the programs      success.
  1) All (.txt) files that are being read from and saved to need to be saved in the same directory as "Arith.py"
  2) You must include ".txt" suffix in the name of your files. (Eg... Read From: math.txt) not (Read From: math)
  3) It is not mandatory to have a file to write to prior to running the program if you do not wish to. I have written it so that if the name of the "Write to:" file does not exist in a certain directory then it will automatically create one for you with the name you put
